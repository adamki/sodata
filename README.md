# Sodata App

## Project Description

Students at Turing School must identify a Real World problem and then solve it by building a Web-App. There is no limit to the Tech stack or approach. You can read more about the project requirements by viewing the spec sheet [here](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

* You must use an external OAuth provider to authenticate users
* You must consume an external API
* You must implement a production quality user interface
* You must optimize your application optimizing your database, implementing caching, using background workers, and sending AJAX requests

### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on  every checkin
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

# Sodata App

### Pitch

Sodata App provides a rich set of data from open.seattle.gov. We visual crime trends in the city of Seattle, WA and help bicycles users find safer timer and areas to park their bike.

### Problem

Sometimes finding a decent bicycle rack is next to impossible. Sodata helps solve that by providing relevant tools to anybosy. We also allow users to sign up and regsitered their bike(s). If a bike does go missing, we can dispatch a "Bike Alert" to all fellow users to keep an eye out.

### Target Audience

Just about anyone that uses a bicycle.

### Instructions

If you would like to run this app in local production mode:

`git clone git@github.com:adamki/sodata.git`
`rails s`
