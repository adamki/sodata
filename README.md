## Project Description

Students at Turing School must identify a Real World problem and then solve it by building a Web-App. There is no limit to the Tech stack or approach. You can read more about the project requirements by viewing the spec sheet [here](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

* You must use an external OAuth provider to authenticate users
* You must consume an external API
* You must implement a production quality user interface
* You must optimize your application optimizing your database, implementing caching, using background workers, and sending AJAX requests

### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on  every checkin
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

# Sodata App

### Pitch

Sodata App is a Crime Data Analysis Application that compares Real Crime Data and Open Data from Socrata API and Bureau of Labor API. The end goal is to provide valuable research and Data Anaylsis for Major US cities.
 
### Problem

Open Data has the potential to inform and educate the general public. I would like to build a relevant ant meaningful outlet for end-users to see real-time crime incidents in their general vicinity.

### Target Audience

Just about anybody, in the supported cities will be able to monitor their neighborhood Crime levels and filter them by type and date.

### Instructions

If you would like to run this app int local production mode:

`git clone git@github.com:adamki/sodata.git`
`rails s`
